# Reinforcement-Learning-with-Frozen-Lake-and-Lunar-Lander
This project explores reinforcement learning using Gymnasium environments. It begins with Q-learning on FrozenLake to examine the effects of gamma and learning rate, followed by implementing a Double DQN (DDQN) in PyTorch to solve the LunarLander-v2 environment, demonstrating stable training and improved reward over episodes.
